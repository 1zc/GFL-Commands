# GFL-Commands
Simple plugin providing basic commands for GFL CS:GO Servers.

## Installing

- Grab the latest ZIP file from the releases tab. (https://github.com/1zc/GFL-Commands/releases)
- Extract the zip file into the csgo folder on your server.
- Load the plugin before continuing so GFL-Commands.cfg gets generated in `csgo/cfg/sourcemod`. (Can be done either by restarting the server or by using `sm plugins load gfl_cmds` in your server console.)
- Edit GFL-Commands.cfg as you need for your server. There is only one conVar, and it is to toggle the /discord command.
- Edit the `gflcmds.phrases.txt` file in `csgo/addons/sourcemod/translations` with the correct links for your donation page, rules page and Discord server.
